# 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops

## Resources 
* nested while loops
* c-functions
* learning to program in C
* purpose of a function prototype
* C -Header files

## Objective
explain to anyone without the help of Google

## General
 * nested loops  and how to use them
 * function and how to use them
 * difference between declaration and definition of a function
 * what is a prototype
 * scope of variables
 * what are gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89
 * what are header files and how to use them with #include

## Requirements
 * compile with gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -stg=gnu89
 * files should end with a new line
 * this README.md
 * use betty style
 * don't use global variables
 * no more than 5 functions per file
 * don't use the standard library
 * use _putchar
 * include prototypes of all functions and prototypes of the function _putchar in header file main.h and push it.
