## Resources
  * function pointer in C
  * pointer to functions
  * function pointer in C/C++
  * why pointers to functions?
  * everything you need to know about pointers in C

## objectives
  * function of pointers and how to use them
  * what does a function pointer actually hold
  * where does a function pointer point to the virtual memory

  * compile using gcc using options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
  * all files should end with a new line
  * this README.md at the end of this directory

  * don't use global variables
  * no more than 5 functions per file
  * malloc, free and exit are the only C standard library functions allowed
  * _putchar is allowed
  * the  prototype of all your functions and the prototype of _putchar should be included in your header file called function_pointer.h
  * remember to push header files
  * header files should include guarded
