Requirements:
editors: vi, vim, emacs
compiler; gcc
all files end with a new line
this README.md
used Betty style and checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
no global variables used
no more than 5 functions in per file
standard library scritly forbidden
used the putchar.c and implemented _putchar
included all function prototypes as well as _putchar in the header file main.h
header file pushed
no loop used
