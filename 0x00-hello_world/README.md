	{
		//code block
	}
```

### Objective

* why c is awesome `
* who invented c
* who is Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan and Linus Torvalds
* what happens when you type gcc main.c
* what is an entry point
* what is main
* how to print text using printf, puts and putchar
* how to get size of a specific type using the unary operator sizeof
* how to compile using gcc
* what is the default program name when compiling with gcc
* what is the official C coding style and how to check your code with [betty-style](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/wJg_qB9ducisfVQNk62htg)
* how to find the right header to include in your source code when using a standard library function
* how does the main function influence the return value of the program

### Requirements
***
#### 1. C 

+ vi, vim, emacs~
+ gcc compiler
+ all files end with a new line
+ a README.md file
+ no errors during compilation
+ not allowed to use system

***
#### 2. Shell Scripts

- use linux
- scripts end exactly two lines long ' $ wc -l file '
- end with a new line
- first line should be '#!/bin/bash'
