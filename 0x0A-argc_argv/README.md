**Learning Objective:**

Explain the concepts of `argc` and `argv` to anyone without using external references.

**argc and argv Explanation:**

`argc` and `argv` are used in the `main` function of a program to receive inputs from the command line. 

- `argc` is an integer that counts the number of arguments passed to the program.
- `argv` is an array of strings that holds the actual command-line arguments as pointers.

For example, if you run a program like this: `./my_program arg1 arg2 arg3 arg4`, 
- `argc` will be 5 (as there are five arguments, including the program name).
- `argv[0]` will point to `"./my_program"`.
- `argv[1]` will point to `"arg1"`.
- `argv[2]` will point to `"arg2"`.
- `argv[3]` will point to `"arg3"`.
- `argv[4]` will point to `"arg4"`.

This allows us to work with the passed arguments in the program and achieve various tasks, such as parsing arguments or extracting the program name and values.
