# Bit manipulation

Bit manipulation, also known as bitwise manipulation, is a  technique in programming that
involves manipulating the individual bits (binary digits) within a binary number or a binary representation of data. The manipulation is performed using bitwise operators, such as
AND, OR, XOR, NOT, left shift, and right shift. These operators allow you to perform
various operations on the individual bits of one or more binary values.

## Bitwise operators and their purpose
- AND (&): Performs a bitwise AND operation between two binary numbers. It sets a bit to 1
only if the corresponding bits in both operands are 1.
- OR (|): Performs a bitwise OR operation between two binary numbers. It sets a bit to 1 if
either of the corresponding bits in the operands is 1.
- XOR (^): Performs a bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) operation between two binary numbers. It 
sets a bit to 1 if the corresponding bits in the operands are differnt.
- NOT (~): Performs a bitwise NOT operation on a binary number. It inverts ech bit, turning
1s into 0s and vice versa
- Left shift (<<): Shifts the bits of a binary number to the left by a specified number of
positions, effectively multiplying the number by 2 raised to the power of the shift count.
- Right shift (>>): Shifts  the bits of a binary number to the right by a specified number
of positions, effectively diving the number by 2 raised to the power of the shift count


Bit manipulation is commonly used in low-level programming, embedded systems, and
optimization tasks where you need to work with individual bits to conserve memory, improve
performance, or interact with hardware. It is also used in various algorithms and data
structres to perform operations efficiently on binary data. Examples of practical
applications of bit manipulation include setting or clearing specific flags in a bit mask,
encoding and decoding data, and optimizing code for certain arithmetic operations.
